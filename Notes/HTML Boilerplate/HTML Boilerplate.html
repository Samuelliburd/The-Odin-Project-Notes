<!--

We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites index.html. This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites.

The DOCTYPE - <!DOCTYPE html>
The doctypeâ€™s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.
The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

HTML Element - <html
The HTML Element is known as the root element of the document, meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.

What is the lang attribute?
lang specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage.

Head Element
The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.

Charset Meta Element
<meta charset="utf-8">
Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.

Title Element
<title>My First Webpage</title>
Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element

Body Element
The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the <body> element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.
